form the github fundamentals ive learned that github is a version control system that 
allows you to track changes to your code over time and also allows you to collaborate with others on projects.
ive been using github for a few semesters now and appreciate how it allows me to collaborate with others.
I feel that there are still things that i can learn about github and i look forward to learning more about it.
